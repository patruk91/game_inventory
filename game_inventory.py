    Take your inventory and display it in a well-organized table with
    each column right-justified.

    The 'order' parameter (string) works as follows:
    - None (by default) means the table is unordered
    - "count,desc" means the table is ordered by count (of items in the
      inventory) in descending order
    - "count,asc" means the table is ordered by count in ascending order

def import_inventory(inventory, filename="import_inventory.csv"):
    '''
    Import new inventory items from a file.

    The filename comes as an argument, but by default it's
    "import_inventory.csv". The import automatically merges items by name.

    The file format is plain text with comma separated values (CSV).

def export_inventory(inventory, filename="export_inventory.csv"):
    '''
    Export the inventory into a .csv file.

    If the filename argument is None, it creates and overwrites a file
    called "export_inventory.csv".

    The file format is plain text with comma separated values (CSV).
